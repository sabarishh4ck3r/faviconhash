# faviconhash
Faviconhash is a technique used in web security to detect changes in a website's favicon.ico file. The favicon.ico file is a small icon displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks to represent a website. By calculating and storing a hash value of the favicon.ico file, web administrators can monitor changes to this file
